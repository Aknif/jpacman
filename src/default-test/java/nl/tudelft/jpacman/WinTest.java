 * Smoke test launching the full game,

 * This is <strong>not</strong> a <em>unit</em> test -- it is an end-to-end test
 * trying to execute a large portion of the system's behavior directly from the
 * user interface. It uses the actual sprites and monster AI, and hence
 * has little control over what is happening in the game.
 *
 * Because it is an end-to-end test, it is somewhat longer
 * and has more assert statements than what would be good
 * for a small and focused <em>unit</em> test.
